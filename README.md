# AUTH_RBAC
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization. It supports roles like Admin, Client, and Moderator to manage access to different features of the application.

# üéØ Project Description
AUTH_RBAC is a robust web application that implements both authentication and authorization using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) principles and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless session management.

## Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
Secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
Passwords are hashed and stored securely using industry-standard techniques.
Stateless session management using JWT.

2. Role-Based Authorization:
Access is controlled based on assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Client, Moderator).
Each role has specific permissions to access certain resources or endpoints.

3. JWT Integration:
JSON Web Tokens are issued to authenticated users for secure session management.
Tokens are verified for every request to protect endpoints from unauthorized access.
Refresh token functionality ensures prolonged authentication while minimizing security risks.

4. Scalable Design:
The project uses modern technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to deliver a scalable, efficient, and secure solution.

# Why These Technologies?
-Node.js: Asynchronous, event-driven architecture suited for scalable applications.
-Express.js: Simplifies routing and middleware integration.
-MongoDB: Flexible NoSQL database for storing user data and session information.
-EJS: Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML views.

# Challenges Faced
-Implementing a robust RBAC system with the flexibility to handle multiple roles.
-Ensuring secure password storage and handling sensitive data efficiently.

# Future Features
-Integrating JWT-based authentication for stateless session management.
-Adding role management features to allow admins to assign roles dynamically.

# üíª Installation Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up the project locally on your machine.

# Prerequisites
Node.js
MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage)

# Steps

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AUTH_RBAC.git
cd AUTH_RBAC

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth_rbac
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION=1h
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_secret_key

4. Start the server:
npm start

5. Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

# üñ•Ô∏èUsage
Once the project is up and running, here‚Äôs how you can use it:

1. User Registration:
Navigate to /register and create a new user by providing username, email, and password.

2. User Login:
Log in with the registered credentials at /login.

3. Accessing Protected Endpoints:
Include the issued JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests:
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

4. Refreshing Tokens:
Use the refresh token endpoint to generate a new JWT when the current one expires.

5. Role-Based Access:
Access to certain routes or features will depend on the user‚Äôs role.

# üöÄ Features

1. Authentication:
Secure user registration and login with password hashing.
Stateless session management using JWT.

2. Authorization:
Role-based access control to protect routes.
Middleware to verify JWTs and user roles.

3. Security Enhancements:
Tokens are signed and verified using secret keys.
Refresh tokens are implemented for extended session management.

4. User Management:
Admins can view and manage users.

# ü§ù How to Contribute
We welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature-name.
3. Make your changes and commit them: git commit -m 'Add new feature'.

# üß™ Testing
I recommend writing unit and integration tests to ensure the application works correctly. 

1. Install Testing Dependencies:
npm install --save-dev jest supertest

2. Write Tests: Create test files in the /tests directory. Here‚Äôs an example:
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

test('GET / should return status 200', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/');
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
});
